# cx-demo

Python Demo to show simple cx_oracle demo. This has been developed against an Oracle 18XE Docker image with the Sample HR Schema.

Development is local and the scripts are then packed in a Dockerfile for Distribution. CI is then done through Jenkins using the jenkinsfile. Production is an Autonomous Oracle DB in the Oracle Cloud Infeastructure(OCI).

NOTE : Some aspects of this code are for demonstration purposes. This is not intended to be a complete Application so use at your discretion.
